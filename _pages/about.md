Hello there, this is Tyler. I am a computational biologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute working closely with my advisors [Saud Aldubayan](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/saud-h-aldubayan-md/), [Elizer Van Allen](https://vanallenlab.dana-farber.org/), and the [Breast Oncology Department](https://www.dana-farber.org/breast-oncology-program/). Previously I worked with [Animesh Sinha](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=aasinha) and cannot thank him enough for introducing me to the world of research. My overall interest is in precision oncology, and comparative genomics, in particular how to use an indivdual's genomic information can lead to clinical management and precision medicine. Currently my research focuses on understanding the genetic architecture and mutational landscape of breast cancer translating biolocial findings into clinical actions. Feel free to explore the pages to take a look at my recent works or CV. 

Computational biology is a passion of mine because it allows me to innovate, discover, and make real-life impacts to patients' lives. I am always open to collaborations so if any projects I have worked on or am working on sounds interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! I am also working towards my M.S. in bioinformatics at Johns Hopkins University under the guidance of Sherry Ogg. Afterwards I plan on applying to Ph.D programs so if you know of any where you think I will be a good fit, please let me know!
Thanks for reading!

\- Tyler
