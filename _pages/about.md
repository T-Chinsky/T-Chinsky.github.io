Hello there, this is Tyler. I am a computational biologist at the University at Buffalo working closeley with my advisors [Jonathan Bard](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/education/ggb/faculty.html#:~:text=MD%0AAssociate%20Professor-,Jonathan,-Bard%2C%20PhD%0AAssociate) and [Donald Yergeau](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/education/ggb/faculty.html#:~:text=Donald-,Yergeau,-%2C%20PhD%0AAssociate%20Director). Previously I worked with [Saud Aldubayan](https://www.dfhcc.harvard.edu/insider/member-detail/member/saud-h-aldubayan-md/), the [Breast Oncology Department](https://www.dana-farber.org/breast-oncology-program/) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and [Animesh Sinha](https://medicine.buffalo.edu/faculty/profile.html?ubit=aasinha) and cannot thank them enough for introducing me to the world of research. My overall interest is in precision oncology, and comparative genomics, in particular how to use an individual's genomic information can lead to clinical management and precision medicine. Currently, my research focuses on understanding the genetic architecture and mutational landscape of breast cancer translating biological findings into clinical actions. Feel free to explore the pages to take a look at my recent works or CV. 

Computational biology is a passion of mine because it allows me to innovate, discover, and make real-life impacts on patients' lives. I am always open to collaborations so if any projects I have worked on or am working on sound interesting to you, please don't hesitate to reach out! I recently completed my M.S. in computational biology from Johns Hopkins University, and plan on applying my new-found knowledge to my work and potentially applying to Ph.D. programs. So if you know of anywhere you think I will be a good fit, please let me know!
Thanks for reading!

\- Tyler
